## Highlights
### Introduction
this paper proposes a ranking-based optimization algorithm to explore the relationship among different proposals for Siamese trackers.

## Abstract
 

## Tracking Results and Pretrained Model

**Tracking results:** the raw results of SiamRPN++-RBO/SiamBAN-RBO/SiamPW-RBO/TransT-RBO can be found [here]().
